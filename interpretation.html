            <h1>Understanding Your IntelliTest Score</h1>
            <p>Your test results provide valuable insights into your cognitive abilities. Each test is scored based on specific performance criteria, allowing you to track your strengths and areas that need improvement.</p>
            
            <h3>Scoring Breakdown: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Game: </strong> Your score is based on the number of moves taken to solve the grid. Fewer moves indicate better memory and pattern recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Attention Test: </strong> Evaluates response time and accuracy in identifying patterns and sequences. A higher score reflects stronger focus and cognitive processing speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience Test: </strong>  Categorized into Low, Medium, and High Resilience based on responses. Higher resilience scores indicate better adaptability, problem-solving, and emotional regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deduction Quiz: </strong>  Assesses logical reasoning and problem-solving ability. Your score reflects how efficiently you can infer, analyze, and draw conclusions from the given information.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What Do Your Scores Mean?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Score: </strong> Strong cognitive ability in that area.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Score: </strong> Decent performance, but with room for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Score: </strong> Indicates areas that need more focus and practice.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How Can You Improve?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice regularly with the practice mode before taking the final test.</li>
                <li>Analyze your results to identify weaker areas and work on improving them.</li>
                <li> Challenge yourself by reattempting tests to see how your cognitive skills develop over time.</li>
            </ul>
